# Tutorials

[all tutorials list](http://iccv2019.thecvf.com/program/tutorials)

1. [7/10][Interpretable Machine Learning for Computer Vision](https://interpretablevision.github.io/) - basics of interpretability.
2. [7/10][Understanding Color and the In-Camera Image Processing Pipeline for Computer Vision](https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~mbrown/ICCV2019_Brown.html) - colors in-depth. 
Comprehending through the slides directly may be complicated, I suggest to find a video recording instead.
