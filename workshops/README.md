# Workshops

I attended

- [Image and video synthesys](https://github.com/andreyzharkov/iccv2019-notes/tree/master/workshops/Image%20and%20Video%20Synthesis:%20How%2C%20Why%20and%20%22What%20if%22%3F)
I found some of the talks really great and useful (they are saved in the corresponding folder). The other talks were eighter very generic or not practical at all.

- [Preregistration](https://github.com/andreyzharkov/iccv2019-notes/tree/master/workshops/Preregistration). In this workshop organizers explained the main problems
in the current research in modern Computer Vision. Despite it is not yet clear how to overcome these issues completely I highly recommend for everyone to take a look.

I didn't attend, but looks interesting (or I was told they are interesting)

- [Neural architects](https://github.com/andreyzharkov/iccv2019-notes/tree/master/workshops/Neural%20Architects) Impractical, but interesting

- [Interpretation](https://github.com/andreyzharkov/iccv2019-notes/tree/master/workshops/Interpretating%20and%20Explaining%20Visual%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Models) Looks good
