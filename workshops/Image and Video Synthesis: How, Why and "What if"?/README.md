## [8/10] Generative models as data visualization (Phillip Isola)

slides in this repo

TL;DR - traversing latent space of gan as an embedding to produce more/less memorable images, zoom in and out, etc. **Works for arbitrary images, not for a specific GAN model**

## [9/10] The Structure and Interpretation of a GAN (David Bau)

SLIDES MISSING

correlation in gans between objects and activations in some neurons (turning on/off some neuron activation we can edit produced images). correlation can be found automaticly

producing a door in a reasonable place works fine, but producing door in the clouds would not work
