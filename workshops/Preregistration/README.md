# Should we preregister experiments in computer vision?

[homepage](http://iccv2019.thecvf.com/program/workshops)

Hot topic, the most of modern papers are useless trash, sota-hacking, 
дикий подгон (получили результаты - придумали объяснение, 
а должно быть наоборот - сначала выдвигается гипотеза, потом проводится эксперимент)

The paper about HARKing is an absolute top. The video talk will be available soon

My main takeways:
- The "preregistration" means that you provide your hypothesys and experimental protocol first. Someone validates and approves it.
Then you do your experiments and analyze the results.
- One obvious benefit is that **after writing this preregestration you will not do complete nonsense**,
so think what you are going to do first, only then do it, do not waste thousands gpu-hours
- The disadvantage is that your hypothesis may fail in an early stage, so all your detailed experimental plan will be useless
- **My proposal (for now) is to do iterative progress. Simple hypothesis -> code + experiment -> follow-up hypothesis -> experiment. 
This will explain how the results were recieved and motivation behind that. 
Then writing a paper this may be simplified, but the experimental protocol and the entire research become more trusted.**
- The discussion group is formed, let's see how far we can go in this scenario
